        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>I LOVE jelly-filled donuts!  I love making them for friends to take on all of our adventures, because what could possibly be more nutritious, hearty, and just keep you going than a jelly filled donut?  Not to mention how AMERICAN they are!  And kid friendly!  So everyone, make jelly filled donuts for your hiking trip which involves battling little critters and half-brained villains today!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups All purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup Whole-wheat pastry flour</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoon (or 0.25 oz packet) Yeast</li>
            <li>¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon Sugar (separated)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Nutmeg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Melted Margarine</li>
            <li>½ cup Superfine Sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup Jelly/Jam</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar with 1 cup of warm water in a measuring cup. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the mixture is frothy and smells yeasty.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flours, remaining sugar, salt, baking powder and nutmeg in a large bowl. Grease separate bowl with oil.</li>
            <li>Stir yeast mixture into flour mixture with a wooden spoon until sticky dough forms. Add up to ¼ cup warm water to make smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Stir in the melted margarine.</li>
            <li>Dough is very soft and sticky at this stage. Turn it onto a well floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes using extra flour as kneaded, until the dough is soft, smooth and pliable.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 ½ hours.</li>
            <li>Flour a baking sheet. Roll the dough into ¼" thick round on a well-floured surface. Cut into circles using 2" round cutter and place them on the floured baking sheet.  Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil until hot but not smoking. Fry donuts in oil for 3-5 minutes, or until deep golden brown on all sides, flipping 2-3 times. Drain on paper-towel lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roll the donuts while still warm in superfine sugar. Cool.</li>
            <li>Poke small hole in side of each donut with a toothpick or a skewer. Using a pastry bag fitted with small round tip, fill each donut with 1 tsp of jam/jelly.</li>
        </ol>
